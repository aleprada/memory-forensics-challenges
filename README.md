**Memory forensics Challenges** 
This repository contains a list of memory forensics challenges that I've been solving using the volatility tool for getting more hands-on experience in this forensic field.  I'm working on writing brief write-ups for each challenge that I've been solving during the last 2 months. My idea is to keep solving memory forensics challenges and to update this repository from time to time.

I've chosen challenges from the following websites:
* [Volatility foundation samples](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Memory-Samples)
* [CCN-CERT Atenea](https://atenea.ccn-cert.cni.es/)
* [Cyberdefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/)

   
**The Volatility Foundation**
The volatility foundation is a non-profit organisation that promotes and maintains Volatility, the popular open-source tool for memory forensics. On their Github, you can find a good list of some memory samples from different sources such as CTFs, books or malware samples.

**CCN-CERT ATENEA** 
ATENEA is a CTF platform hosted by the CCN-CERT, the Spanish Government CERT. ATENEA contains different types of challenges such as memory forensics, reversing or cryptography.

**Cyber Defenders**

Cyberdefenders is a great training platform for BlueTeams to test their CyberDefense skills. The platform contains many free challenges of different types such as Malicious Documents, Reversing, Memory Forensics, etc.
