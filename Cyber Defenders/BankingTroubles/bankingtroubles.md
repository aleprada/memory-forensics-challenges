## Description

A Linux server was possibly compromised and a forensic analysis is required in order to understand what really happened. Hard disk dumps and memory snapshots of the machine are provided in order to solve the challenge.

Challenge Files:

* victoria-v8.kcore.img: memory dump done by ddâ€™ing /proc/kcore.
* victoria-v8.memdump.img: memory dump done with memdump.
* Debian5_26.zip: volatility custom Linux profil

## Solution

### 1)	The attacker was performing a Brute Force attack. What account triggered the alert?


### 2)	How many were failed attempts there?

### 3)	What kind of system runs on the targeted server?


### 4)	What is the victim's IP address?


### 5)	What are the attacker's two IP addresses? Format: comma-separated in ascending order?

### 6) What is the "nc" service PID number that was running on the server?

### 7)	What service was exploited to gain access to the system? (one word)?


### 8)	What is the CVE number of exploited vulnerability?


### 9)	During this attack, the attacker downloaded two files to the server. Provide the name of the compressed file.

### 10)	Two ports were involved in the process of data exfiltration. Provide the port number of the highest one.

### 11)	Which port did the attacker try to block on the firewall?
